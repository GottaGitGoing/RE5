//
// The job of a GroceryPurchase is to calculate the totals owed for a
// purchase of groceries made by a customer, given a sequence of
// GroceryItems.  It calculates three different values:
//
// * The subtotal, which is the total amount owed without including sales
//   tax.
// * The sales tax owed for any items that are taxable.
// * The overall total, which is the sum of the subtotal and the sales tax.
//
// All amounts are represented in cents.  Tax amounts are truncated to a
// number of cents on each item (e.g., if an item costs $1.99 without tax
// and the tax rate is 3.5%, the tax owed would be $0.06).
